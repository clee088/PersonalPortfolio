                    Hi, my name is <h3 style="display:inline;">Christopher Lee</h3>!
                    <p>
                        I am currently a first-year student at Kenyon College pursuing a bachelor's degree, intending to major in
                        Economics with
                        a Scientific Computing concentration. Passions of mine include software development, machine learning,
                        algorithmic
                        trading, and investment portfolio management.

                        In my free time, I enjoy programming Python projects or developing iOS apps with Swift.  I also
                        activley manage my personal investment portfolio and analyze companies to invest in with financial and 
                        technical analysis.

                            I have always been fascinated by algorithmic trading. Thus, I created
                            TradeBot, a Python program that calculates buy and sell signals based on technical
                            indicators. The program tracks one symbol and each minute, gets market data
                            from Alpaca API and adds that data to an SQLite database. Every hour, TradeBot
                            will calculate the indicators and determine if it should buy, sell, or do nothing
                            based on certain criteria.

                            TremorAnalysis is an app I started development on in June 2020.  My father, a neurologist, had
                            always said he was searching for an app that he could use that would measure his patients'
                            tremor frequencies.  I attempted to solve this problem by creating TremorAnalysis.  TremorAnalysis
                            utilizes Apple's Accelerate framework in order to compute the component frequency by using Fast Fourier
                            Transform. TremorAnalysis also uses Core Motion to gather accelerometer data.  I used SwiftUI as this is
                            Apple's future framework and I would like to have a strong understanding of SwiftUI.

                            InvestingForAll is my first app I developed with SwiftUI.  When I started learning the basics of investing, I was constantly searching
                            for a simple investment app that could simulate a real portfolio, but without the risk of using real money.  This lead me to create my own app
                            that fetched data from a stock API (IEX) and present it in a user-friendly way.
                            I initally created InvestingForAll with Swift in 2019; however, as
                            soon as SwiftUI was released, I immediatly recreated it with SwiftUI and expanded on its features.  InvestingForAll features
                            an overview of market statistics such as the performance of sectors and indices.  It also provides a search feature
                            to search for a given stock and provides the user with a detailed quote, including a chart of historical prices.  
                            The main feature, however, was the simulated investment portfolio.  Users could buy and sell simulated stocks during market hours
                            it would track the performance of their portfolio.
